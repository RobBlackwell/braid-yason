braid-yason
===========

Braid middleware for dealing with JSON in http requests and responses.

See tests.lisp.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL CODE THAT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. I welcome
feedback, but it's probably too early to consider including in
Quicklisp yet. That doesnt stop you trying it with quicklisp by using
[local-projects](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/faq.html).
